Our project aims to predict the sales from Black Friday, the legendary shopping extravaganza following Thanksgiving.Retailers struggle to predict how much they will sell on Black Friday. 
This uncertainty makes it difficult for them to make smart decisions about things like how much stock to order or how to price their products. 
If they don't get these decisions right, they can end up with too much or too little inventory, which can lead to financial losses ordisappointed customers.
So, the challenge is to find a way to accurately predict Black Fridaysales, so retailers can plan better and make the most of this important shopping day
